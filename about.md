I received by undergraduate education from the University of California Irvine in Psychology, and a Minor in Biology. My areas of study are diverse but focus primarily on problems in Learning and Memory. Recently my interests have shifted into the realm of Computer and Data Sciences specifically Machine Learning and Data Visualization. I am currently a student in the UCI Extension program earning a certification in Data Science.
