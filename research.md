#### Summary
This work incorporates psychophysiological techniques to examine the relationship between facial muscle activation and perceptions towards risk.

#### Contributions
Primary duties involved running participants through experimental runs followed by post-experiment debriefings. Work further along in the project mostly involved data cleaning and analysis.


## 2017 Smartphones as “Digital Security Blankets”

#### Primary Investigators 
John Hunter, University of California, Irvine
Sarah Pressman, University of California, Irvine
Emily Hooker, University of California, Irvine
Nicolas Rohleder, Brandeis University

#### Summary
This project experimentally investigated the influence of smartphone presence in situations of social exclusion. A laboratory study was conducted to examine how the presence and/or use of smartphones in social settings may buffer physiological stress and psychological distress. Participants underwent a social exclusion stressor with or without their smartphones and submitted multiple saliva samples and self-reported surveys throughout the study. The saliva samples were assayed for salivary alpha-amylase and salivary cortisol, which provided an unbiased observation of physiological stress. Results indicated that the mere presence of a smartphone (not necessarily phone use) buffers physiological stress and feelings of exclusion.

#### Contributions by Patrick
Patrick conducted experimental sessions, collected psychological and physiological data, analyzed statistical results and assisted in various domains of experimental research. He demonstrated his technical expertise by assuming the role of facial coding expert. Patrick used Noldus FaceReader software to analyze the facial expressions of participants as indicators of emotion. He went above and beyond expectations and devised a coding system to better capture accurate depictions of facial changes.

## 2017 "Experiental" Purchases and Happiness

#### Investigators
Ryan Howell, San Francisco State University
John Hunter, University of California, Irvine
Sarah Pressman, University of California, Irvine

#### Summary
This project examined the emotional correlates of various types of purchases. Participants reminisced about a recent time they spent money on an experience or a material item. These one-minute clips were videotaped and subsequently coded for behavioral responses. Noldus FaceReader software was used to analyze the facial expressions of the participants and indicate the emotional state of the participant. Results indicate that individuals who spend money on experiences express more positive emotion than those who spend money on material items.

#### Contributions by Patrick
Patrick developed a system to more accurately use the FaceReader software and properly analyze the results. He ran the videos through the program, cleaned the data, transformed the values, and created polished versions of the output. He was timely and dedicated in his work on this project. He demonstrated punctuality and reliability in his contributions.

## Instructional and Social Influences on Transfer Students in STEM

#### Investigators

#### Project Funding

#### Summary
Our study used a combination of both qualitative and quantitative measurements to assess the effectiveness of classroom practices in achieving academic success for undergraduate transfer students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses. Using data collected from Project SPROUT in combination with interviews conducted on transfer students in the 2015-2016 school year, we were able to identify how several classroom practices influence student achievement as well as understand students reactions to these practices.

#### Summary
Our study used observations, interviews, document analysis, and video analysis to examine instructional practices in large undergraduate lecture courses at UCI, particularly in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). The study began in 2012 with the intention of documenting the relative presence or absence of practices that potentially promote more active and engaged learning (e.g., enhanced faculty-student interaction, enhanced peer interaction, greater attention to problem-solving strategies, more opportunities for personalized learning, opportunities to receive and communicate information across diverse channels and modalities, more data-based instruction). Now that baseline data have been collected over the course of two years, the study compares instructional practices with student outcome data to determine the efficacy of these promising practices. Our long-term goal is the improvement of undergraduate education and increased retention of diverse learners in STEM fields and beyond.

#### Contributions
My primary job in the project was to conduct up to two weekly classroom observations of STEM class. I recorded and maintained field notes of observations in order to complete the Simple Protocol for Observing Undergraduate Teachings (SPROUT). I also attended weekly project meetings to discuss new developments in the project and update the research staff.
